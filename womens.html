    <h1>Women's Rules</h1>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
        Collegiate Women's Lacrosse is played in 4, 15-minute quarters with two teams of 12 players each.
        The objective is to shoot the ball into the opponents goal using a lacrosse stick. 
        Each team consists of a goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders, and four attackers.
        <br/>
        The game features a semi-circular area in front of the goal, known as the 8-meter arc, as well as an area surrounding the goal, called the crease.
        The area inside of the 8-meter arc is often referred to as the Critical Scoring Area.

    <h2>2026 and 2027 Women's Lacrosse Rules</h2>
    <p>
        Any player not in possession of the ball must immediately leave the field upon their stick breaking, regardless of their location on the field. 
        <br/>
        A coach must be present on the sideline to commence or continue play. If no coach is present, the team must forfeit. 
        <br/>
        Stop the game and possession clock for all fouls in the Critical Scoring Area during the last minute of each quarter and overtime period. Otherwise, the clock runs on all free position shots in the Critical Scoring Area.
        <br/>
        A 30 second clock will begin with the signal of a goal and concluding at the start of the administration of the draw. If one team is not present, possession will be awarded to the opposing team.
        <br/>
        Allow any team that has possession at the end of a quarter to retain possession at the start of the subsequent quarter. Draw will occur at the start of the game, halftime, at the beginning of each overtime period, and after each goal.
        <br/>
        Prohibit the switching of sticks on the field. Anytime a player needs to switch a stick, that player must enter and exit the field through the subsitution area.
        <br/>
        All fouls will be administered at the spot of the foul. However, if administering the foul at that spot would disadvantage the non-offending team, the foul will be administered at the spot of the ball. 
        <br/>
        8 meter free positions will be administered only from the hashes directly adjacent to the center hash. The has used will be determined by the half of the Critical Scoring Area in which the foul occurred. 
        <br/>
        Permit the use of the slow whistle for shooting space, as well as for fouls that occur outside the Critical Scoring Area.
