    <h2>Origins of Lacrosse</h2>
<p>
    Lacrosse was played by the Six Nations of the Iroquois dating back to 1100, prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus. 
    Among some tribes, as many as a thousand players took part on each side, goals were miles apart, and games could last as long as three days.
    Each player tried to disable as many opponents as possible and would attempt to score after this task was accomplished. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Cherokee called their version of the game "little brother of war" due to the endurance required and the injuries sustained. 
    It was considered excellent training for combat. Some tribes even used it as a social event, or to settle disputes. 
    In some areas, men and women played together, and in other areas women had their own version of the game.

<h2>Canada and Lacrosse</h2>
<p>
    Europeans in Canada started playing the game around 1840, and the first lacrosse organization, the Olympic Club, was founded in Montreal in 1842. 
    Members of the Montreal Lacrosse Club, founded in 1856, modified the rules. In 1867 George Beers of Montreal made further changes that replaced the Indian ball of deerskin stuffed with hair to a hard rubber ball. 
    He also limited the number of players on a team to 12. The 12 players were designated as goal, point, cover point, first, second, and third defense, centre, first, second, and third attack, out home, and in home.

<h2>Lacrosse In England</h2>
<p>
    In 1867 the National Lacrosse Association was formed, and the game was introduced to England. Captain W.B Johnson of Montreal toured with a team of Caughnawaga Indians, appearing at Windsor Castle before Queen Victoria, who found the game "very pretty to watch."
    The English took to the sport and the game achieved popularity, notably in Lancashire, Chesire, Yorkshire, Manchester, Bristol, and London. 
    The English Lacrosse Union was founded in 1892, and the All-England Women's Lacrosse Association was formed in 1912.
    English teams exchanged visits with teams from the United States and Canada from time to time, and combined Oxford-Cambridge teams frequently exchanged visits with college or all star teams from the United States.
    The game was also introduced in Ireland, Australia, and South Africa.
</p>
<h2>Lacrosse in the Olympics</h2>
<p>
    Lacrosse was included in the Olympic Games in 1904 and 1908 with teams representing Canada, the United States, and Great Britain. Teams from those countries also demonstrated the sport in exhibitions at the Games in 1928, 1932, and 1948, but it did not attract enough international interest to remain an Olympic sport.
