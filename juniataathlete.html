    <h2>Meet Me!</h2>
    <img src="media/playing.jpg">
    <p>I am a sophomore lacrosse player at Juniata College in Pennslyvania. I am the defender in the picture above.
        I have been playing lacrosse since I was 4 years old. My older sister played and introduced me to the game. 
        I picked it up with ease and began to love the sport. I began playing club and was interested in playing in college to help with finances.
        As a first generation student, I found it difficult to turn down the opprotunity to take advantage of my talent.

    <h2>Why Juniata?</h2>
    <p>
        When I was initially recruited out of highschool, I did not choose Juniata. I went to a college in North Carolina called University of Mount Olive.
        Once I arrived on that campus I almost immediately knew it was not the place for me. I entered the transfer portal halfway through my first semester of Freshman year.
        I knew I wanted to go closer to home, I couldn't keep driving 6 hours every time I wanted to visit home. I knew that I needed a team of best friends. 
        I wanted to love the people I was around, at I didn't have that where I was. 
        <br/>
        The Coach at the time, Tori Quinn, reached out to me and Juniata met every thing I could have hoped for at my past college. 
        I committed to playing lacrosse at Juniata in the middle of my Freshman year, and arrived in the Spring of 2025. 
        I played lacrosse that season and knew coming to Juniata was the best thing I could have done.
